# FastAPI and Digital Ocean's [App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/app-platform/)
[![Deploy to DO](https://mp-assets1.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/deploy-to-do/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/{mrcartoonster}/{fastapp}/tree/{main})

# The Deploy 🚀
This is a sample repo on how to deploy a FastAPI app to Digital Ocean's *One-Click* deploy PAAS known as App Platform. At this time they don't have an example for FastAPI. They have examples for the rest of Python Web Apps. The most important files here are the `Procfile` and `gunicorn.conf.py` file. This app will run as is and is hosted on the app platform so you can check it out by clicking on that shiny Deploy to DigitalOcean button. If you don't have a DigitalOcean account, use my [link](https://m.do.co/c/beef14f5483f) to get a $100 credit for the first 60 days. You have no excuse to deploy FastAPI now!


## FastAPI ⏩

If you haven't heard of FastAPI, it's a really clean statically and runtime typed Python web framework to make Restful APIs fast! FastAPI's [documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a great resource and will have you up and running with it in no time. I took the time to learn it using TestDrivenIO's [FastAPI](https://testdriven.io/courses/tdd-fastapi/?utm_source=mrcartoonster) course and I can't recommend it enough. You will have to know the basics of the web framework to take the course. Reading the first couple of sections of the FastAPI documentation should be good enough. Or you can calmly learn the basics of FastAPI with Calmcode.io's [FastAPI](https://calmcode.io/fastapi/hello-world.html) video course. When you purchase this [course](https://testdriven.io/courses/tdd-fastapi/?utm_source=mrcartoonster) TestDrivenIO [donates 10% of the course profits](https://testdriven.io/opensource/) to FastAPI and is a [Silver Sponsor](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/#silver-sponsors) of this AMAZING web framework.
